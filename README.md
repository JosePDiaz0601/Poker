# Poker
Online Poker game with GUI
## Online Capabilities
This Poker program has the capabilities for online play! We used a server client model that communicated 
with ports and sockets that simutaneously sent player statuses and synced graphical data.
## GUI
We used the GTK toolkit to build a graphical display for the players to fully immerse themselves.
```bash
Have Fun!!!
